# Antigravity Agent Rules

## 🧠 Context Loading Protocol
You must follow this protocol at the start of every session or when context is lost:

1. **Global Rules**: Read `.agent/rules/GEMINI.md` first. This defines *HOW* I should behave (Socratic Gate, Request Hierarchy).
2. **Primary Index**: Read `.agent/ARCHITECTURE.md` second. This defines *WHAT* tools I have (Agents, Skills, Workflows):
   - 🤖 **16 Agents**
   - 🧠 **40 Skills**
   - 🔄 **11 Workflows**

2. **Skill Loading**:
   - ❌ **DO NOT** read all 40 skill files at once. This wastes tokens.
   - ✅ **DO** use the "Skill Loading Protocol":
     - Analyze the User Request.
     - Match it against the **Skills Table** in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
     - Load ONLY the relevant `SKILL.md` file (e.g., `view_file .agent/skills/react-patterns/SKILL.md`).

## 🔄 Workflow Activation
- If the user uses a slash command (e.g., `/plan`, `/debug`), look for the corresponding file in `.agent/workflows/` (e.g., `.agent/workflows/plan.md`) and follow its instructions exactly.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Rules**: `.agent/rules/`
- **Agents**: `.agent/agents/`
- **Workflows**: `.agent/workflows/`
- **Skills**: `.agent/skills/`

## 🌍 Language & Localization
- **UI/UX Text**: Must ALWAYS be in **Norwegian Bokmål**.
- **Tone**: Professional and clear.
